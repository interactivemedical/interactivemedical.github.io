      <h3>IMIC workshop --- a call for Demos</h3>

      We would like to invite you to actively participate at the Interactive Medical Image Computing (IMIC) Workshop by giving a live demo of your work.  IMIC is to be held in Athenes, on Monday Oct 17 , in conjunction with MICCAI 2016.

      We received many excellent paper submissions and plan to publish the full program very soon.  While the deadline for manuscript submission to the IMIC has passed, there is still an opportunity to take part at the workshop and present your work in demo form.

      The IMIC workshop addresses the topic of human interaction with algorithms for initialization, steering, quality control, and visualization for problem domains such as segmentation and registration, object detection and tracking.

      The workshop format encourages hands-on demonstrations to stimulate interaction between developers and the user community of clinicians, neuroscientists, and biologists. Our focus is on original methods and elegant implementations that establish a human-machine dialog. Evaluation will be based on productivity, accuracy, simplicity, and overall user experience.

      Attendees are encouraged to bring challenging real-world datasets and allow active experimentation with various tools on different data. In this call for participation in the demo session of the workshop we ask for 300 words abstract along with a demo or a link to a toolbox.

      Submissions will be handled in an ongoing basis. We will send an acceptance notification to the demo session within a week of the submission. The latest date to submit a demo is October 1, 2016  but please note that we may reach the number of demos we can accommodate earlier.

      More details can be found in: http://interactivemedical.org/imic2016/


      We look forward to seeing you at the IMIC

      <h2>IMIC</h2>
      <p>Interactive systems are widely used in research and clinical practice, yet most scientific venues make it impossible to fully communicate exactly how they work.  IMIC combines live demos, hands-on examples, and scientific publications to support exchange of ideas among a community of like-minded researchers.  IMIC seeks to showcase and disseminate the best examples of dynamic interaction with medical imagery.</p>

  <p>Submissions will be carefully peer-reviewed by a selected group of researchers with extensive experience in IMIC.
    Workshop presentations are expected to represent a cross section of the best available research in this area.
    As this is an emerging field that has not been historically well-covered in the MICCAI literature,
    accepted submissions will set a precedent that can be expected to be widely discussed.</p>

  <p>Note that the online submission system allows upload of supplementary files, so you may include a video, links to project information or online content, and/or a description of your live demo.</p>

  <p>Materials from the workshop will be collated and made available via the <a href="http://InteractiveMedical.org">InteractiveMedical.org</a> web site as a record of the event and a resource to the field.</p>

  <h6>Paper format</h6>
  <ul>

    <li> Papers should be formatted using the
      <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0" title="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0" rel="nofollow"><font color="#0066cc">LNCS style files</font></a>. </li>

    <li> Papers should have 4-8 pages, but shorter papers accompanied by videos or live demonstrations will also be given full consideration.</li>

    <li> Submissions with video and/or proposing live demonstration will be given higher priority for oral presentation.</li>

  </ul>

  <h6>Parallel Submissions</h6>
  <p>Submitted work has to be original, not identically submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshops. We accept papers that provide further detail on algorithms also validated in the MICCAI challenge workshops. We ask authors to reference the challenge contribution explicitly.<br /></p>

  <h6>Review process</h6>
  <p>The review of the papers will be double-blind to the extent physically possible.
    Submissions should be anonymous according to the MICCAI guidelines.<br /></p>

  <h6>Previous MICCAI submissions</h6>
  <p>If desired authors can upload the MICCAI reviews and rebuttal to be considered by the workshop chairs.<br /></p>

  <h6>Patent disclosure policy</h6>
  <p>The purpose of the workshop is to exchange ideas and methods to advance the state of medical care. Attendees
    of the workshop and readers of the proceedings are expected to be able to implement and use the presented methods
    in their own work.
    <em>Any restrictions on the usability of presented methods,
      whether for commercial or for non-commercial applications, must be disclosed.</em>
    <br /><br />
    This information should be included in a separate section at the end of text in the final ('camera-ready')
    version of the manuscript, and it will be printed in the proceedings in order to help your readers to
    make informed decisions.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="why-imic" class="anchor" href="#why-imic"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why IMIC?</h3>

  <p>The Medical Image Computing literature traditionally favors fully-automated analysis algorithms that offer the potential high throughput, objective, and reproducible results for large data collections.  However fully-automated techniques are not able to handle many time-critical tasks, nor can they handle tasks that require contextual or general knowledge not readily available in the images alone.  This workshop addresses the topic of human interaction with algorithms for initialization, steering, quality control, and visualization for problem domains such as segmentation and registration, object detection, tracking.  The workshop format encourages hands-on demonstrations to stimulate interaction between developers and the user community of clinicians, neuroscientists, and biologists.  Attendees are encouraged to bring challenging real-world datasets and allow active experimentation with various tools on different data.  In the call for participation in the workshop we ask for extended abstracts or short papers that are accompanied by live demos.  Our focus will be on original methods and elegant implementations that establish a human-machine dialog.  Evaluation will be based on productivity, accuracy, simplicity, and overall user experience.</p>
